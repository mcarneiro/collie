# [WIP] Collie - base box modelling to create columns layouts

The main idea of Collie is that sometimes you don't need a gridsystem framework to create the box modelling to use columns in your layout.

It was born from the need of projects with multiple grids defined or no grid at all. Instead of creating a main amount of columns, gutter value, etc. You just use it as it is needed.

This is a mixin for stylus and has 2 versions: IE8 compatible and IE9+. You can use between 3 box modelling techniques: `float`, `inline-block` and `table` (for now, no flex-box yet).

## TODO:

* Basic usage;
* Mixin Reference (function and options);
